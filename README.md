# UPager

UPager is a pure SwiftUI pager for iOS and macOS.

## Why Use UPager

SwiftUI's TabView supports pagination by attaching the .tabViewStyle() modifier to the TabView, passing in .page like below.

    TabView {
        Text("A")
        Text("B")
        Text("C")
    }
    .tabViewStyle(.page)

However, TabView is limited in that it can only handle a fixed number of items and does not support changes in device orientation.
This package provides a pager supporting infinite number of items and changes in device orientation.

## Prerequisites

* iOS 14.0+, macOS 11.0+

You can use Swift Package Manager to add UPager to your project.

1. Add Package Dependency
   * In Xcode, select ``File`` > ``Add Packages...``.
2. Specify the Repository
   * Copy and paste the following into the search/input box.
     ``https://github.com/urarura/UPager.git``
3. Select the Package Products

## Quick Start

1. Create SwiftUI View

   Select ``File`` > ``New`` > ``File...``, then select ``SwiftUI View``.

2. Import UPager

        import UPager

3. Write View

        struct NewlyCreatedView: View {
            @State private var selection = 1
        
            var body: some View {
                UPager(selection: $selection) { element in
                    Text("\(element)")
                } onPageChanged: { element in
                    print("\(element) is currently displayed.")
                } onReachedToFirst: { element in
                    return Array((element-5)..<element)
                } onReachedToLast: { element in
                    return Array((element+1)...(element+5))
                }
            }
        }

   UPager has the following parameters:
   * **selection**: A binding to the selected element.
   The element must conform to ``Hashable`` protocol.
   * **content**: The view for the specified element.
   * **onPageChanged**: The action to perform when page is changed.
   * **onReachedToFirst**: The action to perform when page is
   reached to the first element of cached elements. You must return array
   consective to the cached elements.
   * **onReachedToLast**: The action to perform when page is
   reached to the last element of cached elements. You must return array
   consective to the cached elements.
